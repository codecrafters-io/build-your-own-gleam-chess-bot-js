This is a starting point for Gleam solutions to the
["Build Your Own Gleam Chess Bot JS)" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/gleam-chess-bot).

In this challenge, you'll build a chess bot that's capable of parsing FEN
strings and making valid chess moves.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your Redis implementation is in `src/chess_bot.gleam`. Study
and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

That's all!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `gleam (1.9.1)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your chess bot, which is implemented in
   `src/chess_bot.gleam`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
